# usbGecko-Pico
a USB Gecko clone... for the pi pico

# Why?
Well, the CPLD in the gecko isnt easy to come by, ask me how i know, so im going to attempt to rewrite the Verilog to C code and use it on the pico

# What needs to be done?
Currently, everything
* Translate the Verliog to C
* Adapt the Translated code to run on the pico
* Debug / Test
* Create a writeup / documentation on how to build one
